# Analysis and Visualisation of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Nigeria (2020 - 2024)

## Introduction
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country is a critical indicator of its economic health, reflecting the total value of all goods and services over a specific time period. Understanding the trends and changes in GDP can provide valuable insights into the economic performance and potential growth areas within a country. This analysis focuses on the GDP of Nigeria from 2020 to 2024, providing a comprehensive overview of its performance during this period.

## Objectives

-	Analyze Quarterly GDP Trends. Examine the quarterly variations in Nigeria’s GDP from Q1 2020 to Q2 2024, identifying significant changes and trends in both nominal and real GDP values. Examine GDP trends by sector and subsector.
  
-	Assess Quarterly Growth Rate. Calculate and interprete the quarterly GDP growth rates to understand the economic momentum from one quarter to the next and compare it to the same quarter in the previous year.
  
-	Highlight Key Metrics.  Focus on critical metrics such as the real GDP values, percentage change this quarter versus last quarter and the percentage change this quarter versus same quarter las year to provide a clear picture of economic performance.
  
-	Visualize Data for Bette Understanding. Utilize Excel and Power BI to present the DP data effectively, including line charts to show the quarterly trend of GDP and bar charts to display the percentage change in real GDP for preceding years.
  
-	Provide Contextual Analysis. Offer contextual explanations for observed GDP trends and growth rate, linking economic events, climate and seasonality and policies to their potential impacts on GDP.

## Data Model
The data was first normalized in Excel before being transformed in Power Query. The raw data was split into nominal and real GDP and the indirect tax was separated. A date table was also created in Power Query.

## Impact of Policies, Seasonality and Economic Events
-	The Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) continued policies focused on stabilizing the exchange rate and combating inflation have influenced GDP greatly.
-	Persistent inflation, primarily from high food and fuel prices, remains a challenge for economic stability.
-	Nigeria faced seasonal agricultural production variations due to weather patterns. While the rainy season in Q2 generally supports agricultural output, unpredictable climate conditions, such as droughts or flooding, remain a risk for agricultural productivity. Given that agriculture is vital to Nigeria’s economy, these climate variations have had a noticeable effect on GDP

## Recommendations
-	Align Fiscal and Monetary Policy by stabilizing inflation and the naira through consistent policy coordination.
-	Enhance Agricultural Resilience and improve productivity with modern farming techniques 
-	Address power, roads, and digital connectivity to support industry growth.
-	Boost security to support economic stability, especially in agriculture and oil sectors.
